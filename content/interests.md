| I am been playing basketball for 9 years, including high school variety and college intramural. In particular, I love the sport because its team oriented and allows me to only focus on the game itself. | One of my favorite hobby is traveling. I have been to China, Japan, Paris, Rome, Korea and a bunch of other places. Every travel allows me to see and understand of the bigger world out there and help me to focus on myself.| Listening to music helps me destress and removes me from the busy world I am surrounded by. I enjoy listening to Chinese, Korean, and English songs. Let me know if you have any song suggestions! | One of my favorite part about NYC is the close access to all types of cultural food. I love to explore different restaurants and cuisines. But, nothing taste better than homecooked food made by my grandma.|

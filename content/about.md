My resume is attached[here](/resume.pdf)!

I grew up in New York City, where I was given the opportunity to be exposed to diverse culture, food, and liftstyle. Consequently, cultural diversity, awareness, and appreciation are values that help shape who I am and the work that I put into world. As we transition to remote work due to COVID, I have an American Eskimo name Tofu who loves attention and accompanies me during work!
